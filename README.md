# Amstudio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.
(Windows)
To make use of this projeect cd to the project and npm init as usual. 
The app has a few components, there is google authentication, projects can be added (firebase database), edited and deleted. There is also firebase storage for images and route guards. So I put a lot of work into this and if you are building similar projects, you dont need to go through the stress i went through.
